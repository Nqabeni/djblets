===========================
Djblets 0.9.1 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date**: TBD


djblets.datagrid
================

* Fix errors with datagrid sorting with trailing commas.

  Some search crawlers such as Bingbot can attempt to load a datagrid with a
  sort column list that had a trailing comma, causing a crash. This now filters
  out any invalid column names.


djblets.util
============

* Added support for serializing Django models to
  :py:class:`djblets.util.serializers.DjbletsJSONEncoder`.

  Models which include a :py:func:`to_json` method can now be serialized using
  the basic encoder, which makes it easier to adapt models to WebAPI resources.
