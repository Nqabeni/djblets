Compatibility Changes
=====================

* Updated to django-pipeline 1.6.

  This release uses django-pipeline 1.6, which requires various changes in your
  application. Specifically, you'll need to change your :file:`settings.py`
  file to use the new ``PIPELINE`` attribute, and update your templates to use
  ``stylesheet`` and ``javascript`` instead of ``compressed_css`` and
  ``compressed_js``. See django-pipeline's `upgrade guide
  <https://django-pipeline.readthedocs.org/en/1.6.4/installation.html#upgrading-from-1-3>`_
  for more details.
