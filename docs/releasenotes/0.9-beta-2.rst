Djblets 0.9 Beta 2 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: TBD

This release contains all bug fixes and features found in Djblets version
:doc:`0.8.21 <0.8.21>`.


Installation
============

To install this release, run the following::

    $ sudo easy_install \
        -f http://downloads.reviewboard.org/releases/Djblets/0.9/ \
        -U Djblets

We **do not** recommend upgrading a production server with this version of
Djblets. This version is still in-development, and is not guaranteed to have
API stability.


Compatibility Changes
=====================

This release of Djblets is experimentally compatible with Django 1.8. For the
time being we still recommend using Django 1.6.


djblets.cache
=============

* Enhanced the :py:func:`cache_memoize` implementation to be usable with
  generators.

  When trying to cache data that's being created via a generator, the new
  :py:func:`cache_memoize_iter` method will populate the cache without
  gathering up everything into a list first. Pulling data out of the cache will
  also operate as an iterator rather than preprocessing everything at once.

  Caching large data has also been optimized for speed.


djblets.datagrid
================

* Added a responsive UI mode for datagrids.

  When the datagrid is rendered on a small (<= 720px) screen, it now goes into
  a mobile mode. In this mode, the contents of the datagrid become more
  vertical in order to make better use of the space without making text too
  small.

* Added various blocks to the datagrid templates for better extensibility.

  Rather than just having a big blank white spot, datagrids can now show some
  custom HTML by overriding the ``datagrid_empty`` block.

  The new ``datagrid_titlebox`` block can be used to provide additional content
  before, after, or in place of the titlebox.

  Finally, the ``paginator`` block wraps the paginator, allowing it to be
  removed or replaced.

* Enabled datagrids to use simpler QuerySet-like objects.

  Datagrids are now less tightly bound to Django's :py:class:`QuerySet`, and
  can now use QuerySet-like objects such as Haystack's
  :py:class:`SearchQuerySet`.

* Fixed numerous display bugs and did some small visual tweaks.

* Fixed various performance issues.

* Improved positioning and scrolling of datagrid menus.

* Fixed problems with pagination links and the ``gridonly`` query string
  parameter. (:bug:`3794`)

  Patch by Griffin Myers.

* Fixed the CheckboxColumn to not render links around the checkbox.


djblets.markdown
================

The new :py:mod:`djblets.markdown` module contains a bunch of useful utilities
for dealing with Markdown text. This includes things like escaping and
unescaping, a "WYSIWYG"-style renderer (where the output HTML looks
substantially like the input Markdown), and a variation of the renderer which
can include inline styles (for example, when rendering for use in HTML emails).

These functions were previously part of the Review Board codebase, but are
useful beyond Review Board and have been moved here.


djblets.util
============

* Added height-for-width sizing to the :py:func:`thumbnail` template tag.

  When being used from Python, the thumbnail tag can now be passed a 2-tuple
  instead of a string to represent the size. If the height is omitted, it will
  be calculated to preserve the image's aspect ratio.

* Added a new :py:func:`querystring_with` tag to help with building links.

  When creating links that modify query parameters, it's often useful to
  build a new query that contains all of the previous parameters but with the
  value of one of them changed. This new tag helps with that.


djblets.webapi
==============

* Added a new ``DUPLICATE_ITEM`` error code.

  This is a generic error code that can be used to indicate error states when
  duplicate constraints are violated.

  Patch by Vincent Le.

* Reorganized the authentication code.

  The :py:mod:`djblets.webapi.auth` module has been split into multiple modules in
  preparation for adding some new features. The old names still work, but will
  show a :py:exc:`DeprecationWarning`.


Miscellaneous
=============

* Replaced spinners with FontAwesome_.

  The old animated GIF spinner has been replaced with the spinner in the icon
  font FontAwesome_.

.. _FontAwesome: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
