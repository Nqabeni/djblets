=========================
Djblets 0.9 Release Notes
=========================

**Release date**: TBD


See the release notes for the 0.9 betas and RCs for the complete list of
changes.

The following are the changes since 0.9 RC 1.


djblets.datagrid
================

* Datagrids can now build their own paginators by implementing
  :py:meth:`build_paginator`. This is particularly useful when creating a
  datagrid that integrates with Haystack.

* Optimized database queries a bit.


djblets.mail
============

* Added :py:class:`djblets.mail.message.EmailMessage`. This has been ported
  from Review Board.

* Ensure all e-mail headers are bytes, rather than unicode. This fixes
  :py:exc:`UnicodeDecodeErrors <UnicodeDecodeError>` when sending a message
  that contains non-ASCII headers.


djblets.webapi
==============

* Fixed encoding for API resources using the ``expand`` parameter that would
  create a circular reference. This had previously been fixed, but regressed
  with the addition of field limiting.

* Fixed lookups for resources when using deferred models (such as those
  returned by :py:meth:`django.db.models.query.QuerySet.only`).


Contributors
============

* Barret Rennie
* Christian Hammond
* David Trowbridge
